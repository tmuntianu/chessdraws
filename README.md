For data, [Caissabase](http://caissabase.co.uk/) is used as input to the `data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook

This notebook outputs all the relevant csvs to the `./data/` folder, where it is then ingested by `logistic.R`.
All the code in `logistic.R` follows from the equations described in the paper, the notation is the same and should be clear.

`./notebooks/fighting_chess_index.ipynb` is not used in the paper and was part of the first draft. Perhaps the models enclosed
will be revisited on a later date.
